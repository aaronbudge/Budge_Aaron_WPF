//Conditional Logic

var oldEnough = false;

//if the child is old enough, print to the console "you can ride!"
if(oldEnough){
    //code performed if condition is true
    console.log("You can ride the coaster!");
}


//Relational Expressions

var kidHeight = 40;
var minHeight = 48;

//if the kid is over 48 inches in height
if(kidHeight > minHeight){
    //code performed if condition is true
    console.log("You can ride the coaster!");
}
