//Functions - Variable Scope

//Functions - Parameters and Arguments

/*calcArea(30, 20);

function calcArea(w, h){ //w=30, h=20
    var area = w * h;
    console.log(area);
}

function dogYears(age){ //Parameters
    var dogYears = age * 7;
    console.log("Sparky is " + dogYears + " years old.");

// Functions - Returning Values

var total = calcArea(30,20);

function calcArea(w, h){
    var area = w * h;
    return area; //Function is returning the info back out
}
console.log(total);
